# User Directory


## Description

The employee directory is a React app that uses the random user generator from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) to generate a table of 40 random users along with their associated information. You can filter the table alphabetically by 3 categories: name, email, and username. The table can then displayed in reverse order by clicking a generated arrow button.
